/**
 * Diffing in React
 * 
 * Diffing refers to the process of comparing the current virtual DOM (VDOM)
 * with a previous version to determine what has changed so that React can
 * efficiently update the actual DOM.
 * 
 * React uses a virtual DOM to minimize direct updates to the actual DOM, which
 * improves performance and responsiveness. The diffing algorithm helps React
 * identify which parts of the UI have changed, and only updates those parts in
 * the browser's DOM.
 * 
 * The main steps of the diffing process in React:
 */

// 1. **Reconciliation:** 
// When a state or prop changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree representing the updated UI. 
// The previous and new virtual DOM trees are then compared to identify the differences.

function explainReconciliation() {
    console.log('Reconciliation is the process of comparing the previous virtual DOM with the new one.');
  }
  
  // 2. **Keyed Diffing:**
  // React uses a heuristic to compare nodes in the DOM efficiently. It relies on the "key" attribute in lists 
  // to match items between the old and new VDOM trees. This helps React identify which elements in a list 
  // have changed, been added, or removed, so it can update only the necessary DOM elements.
  
  function explainKeyedDiffing() {
    console.log('Keyed diffing helps React efficiently compare list items by using the "key" attribute.');
  }
  
  // 3. **Component-level Diffing:**
  // React compares each component’s state and props to detect changes. If a component’s state or props change, 
  // React will re-render that component and update only the DOM elements related to that component.
  
  function explainComponentLevelDiffing() {
    console.log('Component-level diffing compares the state and props of components to detect changes.');
  }
  
  // 4. **Efficient Updates:**
  // React minimizes the number of changes made to the actual DOM by applying updates only to the elements 
  // that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire DOM. This is important for performance, as direct 
  // DOM manipulations are slower than virtual DOM diffing.
  
  function explainEfficientUpdates() {
    console.log('Efficient updates mean React only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed.');
  }
  
  // You can expand or add more related information in this file, like how React uses `shouldComponentUpdate`
  // or how hooks affect rendering. Example of adding a new concept:
  
  function explainShouldComponentUpdate() {
    console.log('shouldComponentUpdate allows React to skip rendering when props or state have not changed.');
  }
  
  // Call functions to print explanations to the console:
  explainReconciliation();
  explainKeyedDiffing();
  explainComponentLevelDiffing();
  explainEfficientUpdates();
  explainShouldComponentUpdate();
